# two conditions to be met and checked outside of the while loop with an if statement to return feedback to user, 

#attempt variable is outside of while loop but it doesnt matter becuase scope isnt an issue like it would be with functions


attempt = 0

while True:
    pin=input("PIN:")
    attempt += 1
    
    if pin == "4321":
        break

    else:
        print("Wrong")

if attempt == 1:
    print(f"Correct! It only took you one single attempt!")
else:
    print(f"Correct! It took you {attempt} attempts")
