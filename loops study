Notes on loops with conditions

generally you 

1. INITIALIZE (iterator variables)

2. CONDITION  (determines how many times the loop is performed)

3. UPDATE (update variables to monitor multiple states of variables, avoids infinite loops)


tips for better code::::

hard coding values wthat will be entered by user
# explain the hard value in code

example:

limit = 8 # var = int(input("Enter the limit"))
