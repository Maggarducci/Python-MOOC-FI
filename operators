#Arithemetic operations and f strings:

Using f strings you can place formulas inside of print statements

days = int(input("How many days?"))
# using f string format with calcultion inside f statement
print(f"Seconds in that many days: {days*24*60*60}")







#Example using corder of operations inside of f statement instead of making new variable (unsure if this is good practice)

times = int(input("How many times a week do you eat at the student cafeteria?"))

price = float(input("The price of a typical lunch?"))

money = float(input("how much money do you spend on groceries in a week?"))

print("Average food expenditure:")
print(f"Daily: {((times*price+money)/7)} euros")
print(f"Weekly: {times*price+money} euros")








#Using modulo and division operators combined with if statement

numstudents = int(input("How many students on the course?"))
groupsize = int(input("Desired group size?"))

numgroups = numstudents//groupsize

if numstudents%groupsize  > 0:
    numgroups += 1

print(f"Number of groups formed: {numgroups}")
