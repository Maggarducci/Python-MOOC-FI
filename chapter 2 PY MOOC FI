Syntax is the nature of the coding language and throws easy ot fix errors due to the code not working
Debugging is performed due to non syntax errors that result in undesireable outcomes from the syntactically correct code

Debugging ideas:
1. hard code variables that the user inputs normally and comment out the input lines to see if the expressions are correct
2. then add debugging print statemnts to code to see the values (debuggin line by line with software works but this is file  for manual debugging)
if they dont print then something is wrong at the conditional statement level
3. Use booleans to check conditional statement
4. remove all debugging print statements
