PASSWORD MATCHING USING SIMPLE CODE AND THEN USING DEBUGGING STATEMENTS TO CHECK ON THE FUNCTION
IDE CAN PROBABLY DO THIS IN A MORE ELGENAT AND LESS CONFUSING WAY BUT THIS METHOD IS GOOD FOR A SIMPLE IDE

# Password matching
pass1 = input("Password:")

while True:
    pass2 = input("Repeat password:")

    if pass1 != pass2:
        print("They do not match!")

    else:
        break
print("User account created!")





# multiple loops with print debugging statemnts
#I assume an IDE with a good debugger would make this unecessary 
#will check in visual studio code

while True:
    print("beginning of the while block:")
    code = input("Please type in your PIN: ")
    attempts += 1

    print("attempts:", attempts)
    print("condition1:", attempts == 3)
    if attempts == 3:
        success = False
        break

    print("code:", code)
    print("condition2:", code == "1234")
    if code == "1234":
        success = True
        break

    print("Incorrect...try again")
