BASIC LOOPS WEEK 2 PYTHON
WORKING ON LOOPS and CONDITIONALS WITHJ BREAK STATEMENTS
SATISFYING MULTIPLE DESIRED INPUTS 



# simple loop countdown withprint statement outside of loop after break is satisfied

number = 5
print("Countdown!")
while True:
  print(number)
  number = number - 1
  if number == 0:
    break
    
print("Now!")






# looping until specific input is satisifed

while True:
    print("hi")
    shall=input("Shall we continue?")
     
    if shall=="no":
        break
print("okay then")







# looping until input is satisfied, contains a second triggering condition with print statement

from math import sqrt
while True:
    num=int(input("Please type in a number:"))
    if num == 0:
        break
    elif num <0:
        print("Invalid number")
    else:
        print(sqrt(num))
print("Exiting...")
